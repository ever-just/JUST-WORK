   - Assess directory naming conventions and organization patterns
   - Identify any orphaned or unused files/directories

2. **File Type and Purpose Validation**
   - Categorize every file by type and intended purpose
   - Identify files that may be artifacts, temporary files, or build outputs that shouldn't be committed
   - Verify configuration files are properly placed and named
   - Check for duplicate functionality across files
   - Assess if file extensions match their actual content

### PHASE 2: COMPREHENSIVE FILE CONTENT REVIEW

   - Assess database configurations and connection security
   - Verify API endpoint security and rate limiting

### PHASE 3: DEPENDENCY AND PACKAGE ANALYSIS
1. **Package Dependencies Audit**
   - Review package.json, requirements.txt, and other dependency files
   - Identify outdated, vulnerable, or unnecessary dependencies
   - Check for dependency conflicts or version mismatches
   - Assess license compatibility of all dependencies
   - Identify missing dependencies for declared functionality

2. **API and SDK Integration Review**
   - Analyze all external API integrations for security and efficiency
   - Review SDK implementations and version compatibility
   - Check for proper error handling in external service calls
   - Assess rate limiting and retry logic implementations
   - Verify API key management and rotation practices

### PHASE 4: INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEPLOYMENT ANALYSIS
1. **Backend Configuration Audit**
   - Use MCP tools to check GitHub repository settings and security
   - Audit DigitalOcean configurations, access controls, and security settings
   - Review deployment scripts and CI/CD pipeline security
   - Check database configurations and access controls
   - Assess backup and disaster recovery preparations

2. **Environment and Deployment Security**
   - Review Docker configurations for security best practices
   - Analyze deployment scripts for potential vulnerabilities
   - Check environment variable handling across different environments
   - Assess logging and monitoring configurations
   - Review access controls and permission management

### PHASE 5: DOUBLE-VERIFICATION PASS
After completing the initial audit:
1. **Re-examine Critical Findings**
   - Review all identified security issues with fresh perspective
   - Double-check configuration files and sensitive areas
   - Verify dependency vulnerability assessments
   - Re-analyze authentication and authorization flows

2. **Cross-Reference Analysis**
   - Check for consistency across similar files and components
   - Verify that related configurations align properly
   - Ensure naming conventions are consistent throughout
   - Validate that architectural patterns are followed consistently
